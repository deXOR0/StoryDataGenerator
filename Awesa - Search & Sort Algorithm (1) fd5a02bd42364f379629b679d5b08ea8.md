Chapter 3: Sort your Problems!
<Conversation>

C: After the second run, the list would look like this.

C: 7, 12, 111, 76, 41

C: After the third run, the list would look like this.

C: 7, 12, 41, 111, 76

C: After the fourth run, the list would look like this.

C: 7, 12, 41, 76, 111

C: After the fifth run, the list would look like this.

C: 7, 12, 41, 76, 111

U: Hey, it’s already in the correct order now!

C: Cool right?

U: Does this have a name also?

C: Oh, that’s right, I almost forgot.

C: This algorithm in which you can reorder the list of numbers in ascending or descending order is known as the sorting algorithm.

C: You can also apply this to many more things, for example, the alphabet.

U: Are there more sorting algorithms out there?

C: Of course, %@! Just like search algorithms, there are many variations that you can do to solve the sorting problems. This particular sort algorithm that we used is known as the bubble sort.

U: Bubble sort… what a funny name.

C: Hahaha, I guess it is!

C: If you’re interested in the performance of bubble sort. You need to see how many comparisons are performed.

C: Since you need to compare each number with every other number in the list, you do a number-squared of comparisons. Given the previous list of 5 numbers, you need to do 5^2 comparisons in the worst case or 25 comparisons in total.

U: I see, so just by adding 1 more number, the comparison grows to 6^2 or 36.

C: Yes, this means that the algorithm works in exponential time since the number of comparisons grows exponentially.

U: Ah… that’s a lot of additional comparisons just by adding 1 more number though.

C: I know right! Of course, there is still room for improvement. For example, bubble sort is a very slow way of sorting a list of numbers. To further increase your performance and be a better secretary, you might want to look into:

-   Radix Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Quick Sort

C: There you go! All done! Now you can sort and search through the documents very quickly.

U: Thanks, Compy!

C: You’re very welcome, %@!
